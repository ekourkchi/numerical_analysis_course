What is the arithmetic intensity for the full gravitational N-body
problem when evaluated with a simple nested double loop?
Steps: 1. Write down the equations for the acceleration of each body
(3D), 2. Count the number of floating point operations required for
the evaluation, to leading order. Assume the square root operation is
equivalent to 10 FLOPs. 3. Count the number of bytes that need to be
accessed from memory. 4. Take the ratio.
Based on this ratio, do you think this calculation is floating-point
limited or data-transfer limited?
