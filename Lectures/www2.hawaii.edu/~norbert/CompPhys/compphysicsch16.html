<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >A Nobel prize was awarded for the invention of a method to calculate the
quantum mechanical ground state of many-electron systems. This was based, not
on the invention of a new numerical method or algorithm, nor on the
implementation of one, but on an approximate reformulation of the governing
equation. This last chapter illustrates the power of reformulating equations to
make them amiable to numerical solution.

<!--l. 33--><p class="nopar" > This was a physically guided derivation; with a bit of calculus it could be verified
that this integral indeed satisfies the Poisson equation, and is thus equivalent to
the previous formulation. Each of the three formulations describes the same
physics. The integral is an alternative to solving the partial differential
equation.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   Such methods can be constructed whenever a PDE can be reformulated as
an integral over sources. (Another example is the integral solution to
the diffusion equation given in section <a 
href="compphysicsch15.html#x17-6300015.2">15.2<!--tex4ht:ref: pdes:sec2 --></a>.) If the potential is required
at only a few locations in space or if the charges occupy only a small
portion of space, the integral may be computationally the most efficient
formulation.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   In addition to exact reformulations, there may be <span 
class="cmti-12">approximate </span>formulations of
the problem that drastically reduce its computational complexity. For example,
the gravitational force from a distant star cluster may be approximated by that of
its center of mass. If the approximation is a good one, this can be game changer.
After all, because of roundoff, no numerical result is exact, so fundamentally an
approximation is not necessarily inferior.

reduction is possible in principle.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   The kinetic energy and self-interaction of the electrons expressed in terms of
the charge density, <span 
class="cmmi-12">F</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">n</span>], is called a &#8220;density functional,&#8221; since functional is the
name for a function that takes a function, here the electron density, as an
argument. The functional <span 
class="cmmi-12">F</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">n</span>] is independent of the external potential <span 
class="cmmi-12">V</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">ext</span></sub>; it
describes how the electrons interact with themselves. Once an expression, or
approximation, for <span 
class="cmmi-12">F</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">n</span>] is found, it is possible to determine the ground state
energy and charge density by minimizing <span 
class="cmmi-12">E </span>with respect to <span 
class="cmmi-12">n </span>for a specific
external potential. Since <span 
class="cmmi-12">n </span>is a function in 3 rather than 3<span 
class="cmmi-12">N </span>variables, the
computational cost of this method no longer increases exponentially with the
number of electrons. (It is essential that good approximations to <span 
class="cmmi-12">F</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">n</span>] can
found at a reasonable computational cost, but we will not deal with this
here.)

<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   This chapter described two different approaches for the same problem, one
using the many-electron wavefunction, the other the electron density. With a large
number of electrons only the latter method is computationally feasible. The
problem was split into an expensive part that describes the electrons by
themselves and a computationally cheap part that describes the interaction of
the electrons with the external potential. Molecules and solids are built
by electronic interactions, and the density functional method is one of
the most consequential achievements of computational physics; it was
awarded a Nobel prize in chemistry. The key progress has been achieved
not by improvements in numerical methods or computing power, but
by a sophisticated mathematical reformulation of the equations to be
solved.
