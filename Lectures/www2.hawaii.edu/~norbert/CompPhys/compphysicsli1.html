<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Fundamental scientific discoveries have been made with the help of computational
methods. For example, commonalities in the behavior of chaotic systems, most
prominently Feigenbaum universality, have been discovered by means of numerical
calculations. This required only simple and small computations. An example
at the opposite extreme, using large and complex computations, is the
prediction of the mass of the proton from fundamental theories of matter; only
with numerical computations was it possible to evaluate the theoretical
expressions sufficiently accurate for comparison with experimental measurement.
Such examples highlight the crucial role of numerical calculations in basic
science.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   Even before the dawn of electronic computers, to name but one example,
Milutin Milankovitch spent one hundred full days, from morning until night, with
paper and fountain pen calculations on one of his investigations into Ice Ages.
Today, the same computation can be done in seconds with electronic computers.
Even small numerical calculations can solve problems not easily accessible with
mathematical theory.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   While today&#8217;s students and researchers are trained in the theoretical,
experimental, and observational methods of their field, comparatively little
educational literature is available about the computational branch of
scientific inquiry. Moreover, the rapid advances in computer technology have
changed the way we do scientific computing. As a consequence of such
developments, part of the conventional wisdom about computing has become
outdated.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   This book is a collection of concise writings that expose the reader to a wide
range of approaches, conceptional ideas, and practical issues. Often when working
on the manuscript, it grew shorter, because less relevant material was discarded.
It is written with an eye on usefulness, longevity, and breadth. Short-lived but
useful pointers to specific resources are listed toward the end of each chapter or
section.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   The book takes a broad and interdisciplinary approach. Numerical methods,
computer technology, and their interconnections are treated with the goal to
                                                                          

                                                                          
facilitate scientific research. Viewpoints from several subject areas are often
compounded within a single chapter.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The book can serve as supplementary reading material for upper-level college
and graduate classes in computational physics or scientific computing in general.
It can also be used as sole textbook for a one hour per week graduate class.
Although the book is focused on physicis, all but a few chapters are accessible to
and relevant for a much broader audience in the physical sciences. Sections with a
star symbol (<sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">*</span></sup>) are specifically intended for physicists and chemists. For
better readability, references and footnotes within the text are entirely
omitted.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   I am indebted to my teachers and colleagues, and to many textbook authors
who have, knowingly or unknowingly, contributed to the substance of
this book. They include Prof.&#x00A0;Leo Kadanoff, who taught me why we
compute, Prof.&#x00A0;James Sethian, on whose lectures chapter&#x00A0;15 is based on, and
the authors of &#8220;Numerical Recipes&#8221;, to name but a few. Many friends
and colleagues have provided valuable feedback on draft versions of this
material.

<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >This material is intended as a modernized, broad, and compact introduction into
scientific computing. It is appropriate as main textbook or as supplementary
reading in upper-level college and in graduate courses on scientific computing or
computational physics, astrophysics, chemistry, meteorology, etc.&#x00A0;(the hard
sciences). Prerequisites are basic calculus, linear algebra, and introductory
physics. Prior knowledge of numerical analysis and a programming language are
optional, although students will have to pick up programming skills during
the course. In a 1-credit (1 academic hour per week) graduate course,
I covered 12 of the 16 chapters. A few homework problems are posted
on the website, not yet enough to cover most possible variants of the
course.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   Instead of slides, I use the pdf version of the manuscript to display figures and
tables. The lectures involved interactive exercises with a Mac computer
connected to the same LCD projector. These interactive exercises are
mentioned in the text and based on files in the Programs folder. Each
chapter is designed to cover about one academic hour, but chapter&#x00A0;7 is too
long, and if optional material is left out, several other chapters are too
short.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   The content of the book can be roughly divided into two parts. The first half
deals with small computations. Chapter&#x00A0;1 illustrates how insight can be gained
from numerical calculations, introducing binary floating-point numbers along the
way. The next three chapters provide an overview of numerical analysis, go into
the nature of numbers on computers, and discuss programming languages, which
readies the student to carry out the sample problem in chapter&#x00A0;5. Examples and
homework try to establish the process of computational research as routine:
problem setup, program implementation, testing, analysis of results, and
iteration of these steps. The subsequent chapter elaborates on elements of
this process, and forms a gradual transition into the second part of the
book that deals mainly with large computations. Performance is discussed
first on a hardware level, which then leads into the classical operation
count of numerical analysis. Topics discussed next are random numbers,
algorithms, and symbolic computations. Topics about data are collected in one
chapter, followed by two chapters on partial differential equations applied to
fluids and quantum systems. By the end, the student has been exposed to
a wide range of methods, concepts, and practical material. Even some
                                                                          

                                                                          
graduate level physics is introduced in optional sections, such as almost
integrable systems, diagrammatic perturbation expansions, and density
functionals.
